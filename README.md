## üöÄ Overview

In the journey towards a career in full-stack web development, it is undeniable that we will encounter different kind of form input, whether it is a login form, a subscription form or a survey form and so on. Input form is one of many ways to practice and use the knowledge of HTML & CSS in coding, and inhretenly they are not too difficult to make a form with some validation.

In this repository, the aim is to make a survey form with basic coding languages, as **[HyperText Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=The%20HyperText%20Markup%20Language%20or,(HyperText%20Markup%20Language)) and [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)**.
